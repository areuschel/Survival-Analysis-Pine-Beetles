# Survival-Analysis-Pine-Beetles
Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for ecological monitoring data of mountain pine beetles in Canada.

<h2>Description</h2>

Hello! I am really proud of this project.

I was tasked with finding a published article that challenges traditional survival analysis methods and applying these new methods to a new dataset... along with my own original analysis! For this project, I chose "Continuous-Time Proportional Hazards Regression for Ecological Monitoring Data" (2012) by Feng-Chang Lin and Jun Zhu. The reason I chose this paper is because it is a truly innovative use of survival methods in an ecological setting. Want to read more?

One of my personal interests is environmental sustainability. I believe one of the best ways we can start to understand, protect, and fight for environmental rights is through data analysis. Both the original paper and my own analysis in this project highlight the importance and efficacy of protecting forests against harmful species of beetles.
